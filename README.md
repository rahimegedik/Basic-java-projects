Java Simple Examples
Hello there! This repository contains a collection of very basic Java projects that I've worked on during my school days. They're mainly for my own practice.

## Overview
These projects range from the basic "Hello World" applications to slightly more complex basic projects. They were primarily done to practice and familiarize myself with the Java language.

## Note
These are personal practice projects. Therefore, they might not be the best reference for learning or teaching Java. However, you're free to explore and provide feedback if you wish.

## Setup
To run any of the projects, ensure you have the Java JDK installed:

**Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory.
Compile the desired .java file: javac FileName.java
Run the compiled file: java FileName

## Feedback
Although this repository is primarily for my personal use, I'm always open to feedback or suggestions. Feel free to create an issue, make a pull request, or contact me directly.
