Java Simple Examples
Hello there! This repository contains a collection of very basic Java projects that I've worked on during my school days. They're mainly for my own practice and do not serve any educational purpose.

Overview
These projects range from basic Hello World applications to slightly more complex basic projects. They were mostly done to practice and get familiar with the Java language.

Note
These are personal practice projects, so they might not be the best reference for learning or teaching Java. However, feel free to explore and provide any feedback if you wish.

Setup
To run any of the projects, make sure you have the Java JDK installed:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory.
Compile the desired .java file: javac FileName.java
Run the compiled file: java FileName

Feedback
While this repository is primarily for my personal use, any feedback or suggestions are welcome. You can create an issue or pull request, or contact me directly.
